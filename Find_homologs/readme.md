# This script was made to find homologous proteins using tblastn with >30% sequence identity 90% match length per the assignment 
(but can be adjusted for different requirements in different circumstances)
Our query file is the protein sequence for an organism of your choice against the sequence of a protein from a database - in this class we compared 4 different organsism to the sequence for the histidine kinase domain
