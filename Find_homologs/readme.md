# This script was made to find homologous proteins using tblastn 
- We aimed to find sequences with >30% sequence identity 90% match length per the assignment, but this can be adjusted for different requirements in different circumstances)
- Our query file is the protein sequence for an organism of your choice against the sequence of a protein from a database - in this class we compared 4 different organsism to the sequence for the histidine kinase domain, but again this can be used for any protein sequence comparisons to find the number of homologs
- This assignment was from the 3rd week of class
